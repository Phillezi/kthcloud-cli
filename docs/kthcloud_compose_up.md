## kthcloud compose up

Deploy compose configuration to cloud

### Synopsis


This command allows you to bring up a local compose definition to kthcloud.

It will automatically detect if you have custom deployments in your config that needs to be built.
[!NOTE]: To keep track of custom deployments a file in "./.kthcloud/DEPLOYMENT" is made (relative to the build context of the service). This file contains the UUID of the deployment that the service maps to.

To rebuild services you can apply the --build flag to rebuild all services, or specify the ones you want to rebuild.

Volumes can be defined and created, currently only creation is supported and to remove stuff you need to manually do it.

Environment variables are resolved from .env and .env.kthcloud in the working dir of your compose file. The values are merged, values defined in .env.kthcloud will have priority and override the ones in .env. To see what gets resolved you can use the "kthcloud compose parse" command.

Default behaviour of this command will after creating all the deployments setup SSE log streams from all created deployments to your terminal. This can be skipped by adding the -d flag.
